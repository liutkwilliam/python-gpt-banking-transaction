### Coding Challenge: Dynamic Simulation of Banking Transactions

The following is the original Python challenge generated by ChatGPT 4o on 26 November 2024.

### **Challenge Specification**

1. **Input Requirements:**
    - Accept two files via command-line arguments:
        - `accounts.csv`: Contains account details in the format:
            
            ```
            AccountID,AccountHolder,Balance
            
            ```
            
        - `transactions.txt`: Contains a list of transactions in the format:
        
        Where `TransactionType` can be `DEPOSIT` or `WITHDRAW`.
            
            ```
            AccountID,TransactionType,Amount
            
            ```
            
    - The program must validate these files:
        - Ensure `AccountID` is unique and numeric.
        - Verify `Balance` is a non-negative float.
        - Check each transaction for valid `AccountID`, `TransactionType`, and a positive `Amount`.
2. **Core Functionalities:**
    - **Object-Oriented Design:**
        - Create an `Account` class with:
            - Properties: `AccountID`, `AccountHolder`, `Balance`.
            - Methods for performing `DEPOSIT` and `WITHDRAW`:
                - Prevent withdrawals that exceed the account balance.
                - Log a failed transaction if a withdrawal is attempted with insufficient funds.
        - Define a `Bank` class to manage accounts and transactions:
            - Load accounts from the CSV file.
            - Process transactions sequentially, updating account balances.
    - **File I/O and Logging:**
        - Generate an updated `accounts_updated.csv` file reflecting the new balances.
        - Generate a `transaction_log.txt` file with details of each transaction and its outcome:
            
            ```
            Transaction: DEPOSIT, AccountID: 1, Amount: 500.00, Status: SUCCESS
            Transaction: WITHDRAW, AccountID: 2, Amount: 1000.00, Status: FAILED (Insufficient funds)
            
            ```
            
3. **Control Flow:**
    - Prompt the user if any required argument is missing, and provide an example of how to run the script.
    - Gracefully handle exceptions like invalid files, missing fields, or corrupted records.
    - Allow the user to enter additional transactions interactively after processing the file.
4. **Output Requirements:**
    - A file `accounts_updated.csv`:
        
        ```
        AccountID,AccountHolder,Balance
        1,John Doe,1500.00
        2,Jane Smith,500.00
        
        ```
        
    - A detailed transaction log (`transaction_log.txt`):
        
        ```
        Transaction: DEPOSIT, AccountID: 1, Amount: 500.00, Status: SUCCESS
        Transaction: WITHDRAW, AccountID: 2, Amount: 1000.00, Status: FAILED (Insufficient funds)
        
        ```
        
5. **Bonus Challenge:**
    - Implement a query system where the user can:
        - View an account's transaction history.
        - Display all accounts with balances below a user-specified threshold.

### **Sample Outcome**

1. **`accounts.csv` (input):**
    
    ```
    AccountID,AccountHolder,Balance
    1,John Doe,1000.00
    2,Jane Smith,500.00
    
    ```
    
2. **`transactions.txt` (input):**
    
    ```
    1,DEPOSIT,500.00
    2,WITHDRAW,1000.00
    1,WITHDRAW,300.00
    
    ```
    
3. **`accounts_updated.csv` (output):**
    
    ```
    AccountID,AccountHolder,Balance
    1,John Doe,1200.00
    2,Jane Smith,500.00
    
    ```
    
4. **`transaction_log.txt`:**
    
    ```
    Transaction: DEPOSIT, AccountID: 1, Amount: 500.00, Status: SUCCESS
    Transaction: WITHDRAW, AccountID: 2, Amount: 1000.00, Status: FAILED (Insufficient funds)
    Transaction: WITHDRAW, AccountID: 1, Amount: 300.00, Status: SUCCESS
    
    ```
    

### Optional Exploration Challenge:

- Add support for recurring transactions:
    - Define transactions with a recurrence schedule (e.g., "DEPOSIT 100 every month").
    - Use a configuration file to simulate monthly updates automatically.


### Further Actions and Modifications - working in progress

1. Generated realistic banking transactions csv file with properties of:

- Account ID: make up of 4 characters and 4 digits (variation of 15 different accounts)
- Transaction Date: Be realistic that mostly occurred during daytime and sometimes nighttime but no later than 11pm
- Transaction Type: Deposit, Payment, Transfer, Withdraw
- Category: any
- Amount: any values with restrictions that: groceries up to 300, utilities up to 4 digits, dinning up to 150, entertainment up to 400, transportation up to 100. Withdraw value can only be a whole number, no cents. 
- Deposit value can be sourced from income or reimbursemnet from friends.
- Adjust some of the deposit transaction to include income as a new category, then the description could be working income (up to 1000), bank interest (up to 120), investment income (up to 500), these values can include cents
- Description: proper description like what is the payment for (e.g. supermarket, Japanese dinner, gas bill, etc.)
- ATM cash withdraw location must be from a bank branch, assuming from locations in Sydney NSW.
- Transfer can only be transfer between friends, or transfer fund for payment to someone.
- overall, each transaction record should be reasonable, look legitimate. 

2. Generated a seperate file with a opening balance of each account.
3. Generated a file with Name (first and last name) and password for each account, the password should be made with following requirement:

- must be 12 characters with at least 2 digits, and either * or & or ^ or % or $ or #
